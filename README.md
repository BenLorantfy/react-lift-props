This library solves a problem that occurs when you try to do composition with systems of components. For example, while before you might have this:

```
<Stepper>
  <Step name="my step name" />
</Stepper>
```

Now you can do this:
```
const MyCoolStep = () => {
  return <Step name="my step name" />
}

<Stepper>
  <MyCoolStep />
</Stepper>
```

This let's you encapsulate properties of the sub components so that the parent component doesn't need to know about it's details. It also let's you re-use components, group components, and all the other benefits of composition.

## Roadmap
- Add support for React DOM
- Re-implement using react-call-return once it's more stable, or a [different solution React might introduce](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/987735478672744448). Should be able to do this in a non-breaking way.
